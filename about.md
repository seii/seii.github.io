## Quick Introduction

Hi! I'm Seii, and this is my (most recent) blog. I don't say things very often, but when I do I hope to be instructing others in worthwhile projects or posting reviews of products that I liked.

## Blog Name

A loose translation of the Japanese at the top of the blog is "think freely". I tend to prefer posting what I wish to say in the format I wish to say it in, and I generally enjoy reading posts from others who do the same.
